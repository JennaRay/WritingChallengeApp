# Overview

I know many people (including myself) who want to be writers, who want to write a book some day and even say that they will, but who still never even start that project.
That's where this writing challenge application comes in.

The writing challenge app challenges writers to write every day, a little bit at a time.
There are two different kinds of challenges, the first being a writing prompt challenge, where the user is given a writing prompt to write a short story around. The second is a sprint challenge, where the user can set a certain amount of time and then just has to keep writing as much as they can until the timer is up.
You can have multiple different books, each of their own challenge type.

The purpose of this software is to challenge writers to start writing every day, to improve their writing and to help them be more comfortable with starting the writing process.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
